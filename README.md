Automated tools and AI-assisted analysis for comparing cloud credential policies and feature gates across OpenShift versions.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Quick Start

```bash
make setup       # Install Python deps and pre-commit hook
make lint        # Static checks (same target as Prow)
make test        # Unit tests (tests/)
```

## Overview

This framework helps platform teams identify IAM permission and feature gate changes between OpenShift versions, ensuring proper cloud permissions are in place before upgrades.

### What It Analyzes

The framework performs **13 validation checks** across all scripts:

| Check # | Analysis Type | Description | Pass/Fail Impact |
|---------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **1** | AWS STS Resources | Validates STS policy files in [managed-cluster-config](https://github.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config) | Exit 1 on FAIL |
| **2** | AWS STS Admin Ack | Validates AWS acknowledgment files | Exit 1 on FAIL |
| **3** | GCP WIF Resources | Validates WIF template in [managed-cluster-config](https://github.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config) | Exit 1 on FAIL |
| **4** | GCP WIF Admin Ack | Validates GCP acknowledgment files | Exit 1 on FAIL |
| **5** | OCP Admin Gates | Validates admin gate acknowledgments | Exit 1 on FAIL |
| **6** | Versions & Channels | Validates version availability in release channels and marketplaces | Exit 1 on FAIL |
| **7** | OCM Version Gates | Validates OCM version gate configurations | Exit 1 on FAIL |
| **8** | Feature Gates | Tracks feature gate changes (informational) | Always PASS |
| **9** | API Resources and CRD Diff Validation | Compares live ROSA API resources and CRDs (HCP, Classic, OSD GCP; OSD GCP skipped for 5.x) | Always PASS (SKIP if snapshots missing) |
| **10** | Critical Alerts Diff Validation | Compares live PrometheusRule alerts; recommends inherit / silence / review / not-applicable. Same topologies as Check #9. | Always PASS (SKIP if snapshots missing) |
| **11** | Cluster Install and Delete Validation | Compares live ClusterOperator/node install health (same topologies as Check #9). Delete-duration metrics are not in the snapshot yet. | Always PASS (SKIP if snapshots missing) |
| **12** | Target E2E Validation and alert monitoring | Target-version rosa-e2e JUnit (`junit-rosa-e2e.xml`). HCP, Classic, and OSD GCP. OSD GCP skipped for 5.x. Missing JUnit is SKIP. Failed tests are reported as FAIL in the report (current e2e quality) and do not fail the job. Alert monitoring SKIP until VerifyNoCriticalAlerts exists in rosa-e2e. | Always PASS (SKIP if JUnit missing) |
| **13** | Upgrade Validation from Y-1 to Y with E2E Tests | Y-1 → Y upgrade path from rosa-e2e HCP, Classic, and OSD GCP upgrade periodics. Missing JUnit is SKIP. Failed post-upgrade e2e or unhealthy ClusterOperators FAIL. | Exit 1 on FAIL |

See [Validation Checks](docs/validation-checks.md) for detailed information about each check.

### Run Gap Analysis

```bash
# Auto-detect versions (compares latest stable → latest candidate)
./scripts/gap-all.sh

# Single version auto-resolve (RECOMMENDED)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 4.21  # GA: z-stream (stable → stable)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 4.22  # Pre-GA: cross-minor (stable → candidate)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 4.23  # Other: cross-minor (candidate → candidate)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 5.0   # 5.x: 4.22 → 5.0 (special mapping)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 5.1   # 5.x: 4.23 → 5.1 (special mapping)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 5.2   # 5.x: 5.1 → 5.2 (normal progression)
OPENSHIFT_VERSION=4.22 ./scripts/gap-all.sh  # Same as --version 4.22

# Explicit baseline and target (both required)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22

# Test against nightly builds
BASE_VERSION=4.21 TARGET_VERSION=NIGHTLY ./scripts/gap-all.sh

# Dry-run mode (show versions without running analysis)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 4.21 --dry-run
./scripts/gap-all.sh --dry-run  # Show auto-detected versions

# Custom report directory
REPORT_DIR=/custom/reports ./scripts/gap-all.sh
```

### View Reports

Reports are automatically generated in `./reports/` directory:

```bash
# Open HTML report in browser
firefox reports/gap-analysis-full_*.html

# Parse JSON report programmatically
jq '.aws_sts.comparison' reports/gap-analysis-full_*.json
```

## Quick Reference

### Version Queries (Accepted Builds)

Quick curl commands to check current OpenShift versions from accepted release streams:

```bash
# Get latest GA version from Sippy
curl -s https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org/api/releases | \
  jq -r '.ga_dates | keys | sort_by(split(".") | map(tonumber)) | last'

# Get latest stable for GA line (e.g., 4.21.x)
curl -s https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestreams/accepted | \
  jq -r '.["4-stable"][] | select(startswith("4.21."))' | head -1

# Get latest RC candidate (e.g., 4.22.0-rc.*)
curl -s https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestreams/accepted | \
  jq -r '.["4-stable"][] | select(startswith("4.22.0-rc."))' | head -1

# Get latest EC candidate (e.g., 4.22.0-ec.*)
curl -s https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestreams/accepted | \
  jq -r '.["4-dev-preview"][] | select(startswith("4.22.0-ec."))' | head -1

# All accepted 4-stable versions
curl -s https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestreams/accepted | \
  jq -r '.["4-stable"][]'

# Get latest 5.0 RC candidate
curl -s https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestreams/accepted | \
  jq -r '.["4-stable"][] | select(startswith("5.0.0-rc."))' | head -1

# Get latest 5.1 RC candidate
curl -s https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestreams/accepted | \
  jq -r '.["4-stable"][] | select(startswith("5.1.0-rc."))' | head -1
```

**Note:** These queries return only **accepted** builds that have passed CI testing. The framework uses this endpoint to ensure reliable version selection.

### OpenShift 5.x Version Mapping

The framework supports special version mappings for the major version transition from 4.x to 5.x:

| Target | Baseline | Upgrade Path |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| `5.0` | `4.22.x` | 4.22 → 5.0 (first major bump) |
| `5.1` | `4.23.x` | 4.23 → 5.1 (second path to 5.x) |
| `5.2+` | `5.(x-1)` | Normal sequential progression |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Compare 4.22 → 5.0
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 5.0
# Resolves to: baseline=4.22.15, target=5.0.0-rc.0

# Compare 4.23 → 5.1
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 5.1
# Resolves to: baseline=4.23.0-rc.1, target=5.1.0-rc.0

# Compare 5.1 → 5.2 (normal progression)
./scripts/gap-all.sh --version 5.2
# Resolves to: baseline=5.1.5, target=5.2.0-rc.0
```

See [Validation Checks](docs/validation-checks.md#version-resolution) for detailed information about 5.x version resolution.

Track cloud permission evolution across OpenShift versions for security compliance.

### CI/CD Pipelines
Automatically detect policy changes in continuous integration workflows.

## Exit Code Behavior

Scripts are designed for CI/CD integration:

| Script | Exit 0 | Exit 1 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `gap-aws-sts.py` | Successful execution | Execution error OR validation FAIL (checks 1-2) |
| `gap-gcp-wif.py` | Successful execution | Execution error OR validation FAIL (checks 3-4) |
| `gap-ocp-gate-ack.py` | Successful execution | Execution error OR validation FAIL (check 5) |
| `gap-versions-channels.py` | Successful execution | Execution error OR validation FAIL (check 6) |
| `gap-ocm-version-gate.py` | Successful execution | Execution error OR validation FAIL (check 7) |
| `gap-feature-gates.py` | Always on success | Execution error only (check 8 is informational) |
| `gap-api-resources.py` | Always on success | Execution error only (check 9 is informational; missing snapshots SKIP) |
| `gap-critical-alerts.py` | Always on success | Execution error only (check 10 is informational; missing snapshots SKIP) |
| `gap-cluster-install.py` | Always on success | Execution error only (check 11 is informational; missing snapshots SKIP) |
| `gap-e2e-validation.py` | Always on success | Execution error only (check 12 is informational; missing JUnit SKIP; failed tests reported in the report) |
| `gap-upgrade-e2e.py` | PASS or SKIP (missing upgrade JUnit) | Execution error OR validation FAIL (check 13; failed post-upgrade e2e or unhealthy COs) |
| `gap-all.sh` | All checks 1-7 and 13 pass | Any check 1-7 or 13 fails OR execution error |

**Important:** Validation distinguishes between **errors** and **warnings**:
- **ERRORS** (missing expected changes): Validation FAILS → exit 1
- **WARNINGS** (unexpected changes in managed-cluster-config): Validation PASSES with warnings → exit 0

When unexpected changes are detected, reports include GitHub PR links showing which PR introduced the change, helping identify the context and reasoning behind differences from the OCP payload.

```bash
# Run full analysis; exits 1 if any validation checks fail
./scripts/gap-all.sh --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22

# Parse JSON reports for programmatic analysis
jq -e '.comparison.actions.target_only | length > 0' reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.json
```

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) and [Validation Checks](docs/validation-checks.md) for detailed examples.

## Claude Code Integration

With [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed, simply ask:

```
"Compare AWS STS policies between OpenShift 4.21 and 4.22"
"Analyze feature gate changes between versions"
"Run a full gap analysis for 4.21 to 4.22"
```

Claude will execute the scripts and provide intelligent analysis and recommendations.

## Comparison with osdctl

Gap analysis scripts use the same underlying approach as `osdctl iampermissions diff`:

```bash
# Both use: oc adm release extract --credentials-requests
osdctl iampermissions diff -c aws -b 4.21 -t 4.22

# Gap analysis adds:
# - Automatic report generation (HTML, JSON)
# - Feature gate analysis
# - Combined cross-platform analysis
# - CI/CD-friendly exit codes
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22
```
